Cirql (pronounced Circle) is a simple and lightweight ORM and query builder for [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/) with built in model mapping and validation powered by [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod). Unlike most query builders, Cirql takes a very open approach, providing you with complete control over your queries.

## Features
- üîó Connect to SurrealDB over stateful WebSockets or stateless requests
- üì¶ Support for query batching & transactions
- ‚öôÔ∏è Zod-powered schema validation of query results
- üìù Full TypeScript support with Zod schema inference
- üíé Write flexible queries using the Query Writer API

## Notice
Cirql is still in early developmental stages. While you can use it for production applications, it may still lack specific features and edge cases. Feel free to submit feature requests or pull requests to add additional functionality to Cirql. We do ask you to please read our [Contributor Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

While we try to prevent making any significant API changes, we cannot guarantee this.

The first step to use Cirql is to install the package from npm, together with a supported version of zod.

```
